Today I'm writing about my current camera gear for anyone who might be interested, and for my future self.

## Photography Gear
- *Contax G1* -- 28mm, 45mm, 90mm lenses
- *Fujifilm X100V* -- 35mm equivalent FOV, and WCL/TCL (28mm, 50mm)
- *Ricoh GR III* -- 28mm equivalent FOV

### My Desert Island Camera

If I could only keep one camera today, it would be the Fujifilm X100V.

It's the most versatile camera I own, and it's a lot of fun to shoot with.  The hybrid EVF/OVF is excellent, and it's weather resistant (when a filter is attached).

While it's not pocketable like the GR III, it's still small enough that I can take it almost anywhere and not feel like I'm lugging a ton of gear.

I bought my first mirrorless camera back in 2017 - the Fujifilm X-T20 with a 50mm F2 WR lens (76mm FOV on full frame), and the kit lenses.

I later bought the 16mm F1.4 and 35mm F1.4 lenses as well, and then a few more lenses on top of that.  Before long I had accumlated way too much gear, and I felt overwhelmed.

In 2018, I decided to buy the Fujifilm X100F, and over the next couple years I found that I used the X100F way more than the X-T20 or any of my cool lenses for that camera - the ergonomics just felt way nicer, and the focal length was just right.  I could take it with me everywhere.

Instead of being faced with decision paralysis as to what focal length I wanted to use every time I went to shoot, I took my X100F, and I didn't have to think; I could just focus on capturing my life and it helped me improve as a photographer.

So, after a couple years with the X100F I ended up deciding to sell all of my gear (X-T20, all my lenses, and the X100F as well) and I upgraded to the X100V in fall 2020.  Since then it's been my most-used camera.

## Videography Gear
- *Canon EOS M* -- Magic Lantern, 15-45mm, vintage Helios 44-2 58mm, Viltrox speedbooster
- *Zoom F1* -- audio recorder with shotgun, mid/side mics
- Camvate EOS M Cage, Smallrig wooden mini handle, USB battery pack

I put this rig together after being inspired by watching the sort of results [Zeek](https://www.youtube.com/@ZeekEOSZ) got with this camera.  It's a really affordable way to shoot RAW video!

Magic Lantern does have a bit of a learning curve, but it's been stable shooting in the 1080p mode.
