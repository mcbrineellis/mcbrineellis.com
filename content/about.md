Hi!  My name is Connor.

I'm from Toronto, Canada and I'm currently living in Fukuoka, Japan.

I work for ThinkOn, a Canadian Cloud Services Provider (CSP) as a Linux Systems Engineer.  Currently I'm fascinated with adopting {{%sidenote "SRE" %}}**Site Reliability Engineering**: software engineering practices developed by Google to run reliable production software systems{{% /sidenote %}} practices to deploy, automate and monitor IT infrastructure.

I have a passion for street photography & playing music with friends!  You can listen to me play drums with Polson on <a href="https://polson.bandcamp.com/album/wide-awake-and-dreaming">Bandcamp</a>!
